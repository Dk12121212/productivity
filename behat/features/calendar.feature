Feature: Calendar in app
  In order to be able to access the calendar
  As an authenticated user
  We need to be able to add and view events in the calendar.

  @javascript @wip
  Scenario: Show the calendar.
    Given I login with user "admin"
    When  I open the calendar
    Then  I should see "Hide Calendar"
